# sage interact
Shows an example of usage of sage interact.

In this example, we used sage `interact` and `animate` to show how fast a function moves when its period changes. We used the function `sin(nx)^a`, it's derivative and its integral. 
The resulting graph is a plot of the three functions. Sage `interact` is used to chage the values of `a` and `n` which overally change the three functions, i.e. change the period, shape or amplitude of the graph. A ball moves along each graph and its speed shows how fast a function moves.
